# How to Install

**This custom card requires Mini Media Player!** Before installing the AmpliPi custom cards, [download and install Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player), which can be found via the HACS searchbar. You also need to have the [main AmpliPi Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/micro-nova/hacs_amplipi/) in order for this card to function properly.

The rest of the guide assumes that Mini Media Player is fully installed.

## Using HACS

The AmpliPi Custom Card can be installed in the same way as the [main AmpliPi Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/micro-nova/hacs_amplipi) using HACS. You can follow the same instructions as the integration, and swap out the link to the repo with `https://github.com/micro-nova/AmpliPi-HomeAssistant-Card`, and use type `Dashboard`.

## Manual Install
1. Download `amplipi-cards-bundle.js` from the latest release on the GitHub repo.
1. Put `amplipi-cards-bundle.js` inside of the `www` directory on your Home Assistant. This can be done using the File Editor from the Add-Ons store on Home Assistant.
1. On HomeAssistant, navigate to **Settings** -> **Dashboards**. On the Dashboards screen, open the 3 dot hamburger menu and select **Resources**.
1. On the Resources screen, click **Add Resource**. Assuming the JavaScript bundle is located at `www/amplipi-cards-bundle.js`, set the URL of the new resource to `/local/amplipi-cards-bundle.js`. The resource type should be JavaScript module, and Home Assistant should automatically select that option once it detects the URL was a JavaScript file.
1. **Delete the cache from** and restart your web browser. If all went well, you should be able to add the AmpliPi Zone Card and AmpliPi Group Card to your Home Assistant Dashboard.
